# AgileEngine

This project contains an AgileEngineApi api which contains 2 httpget methods and an httppost method. 
This api saves data in memory when used. On the other hand we have a website which acts as an interface for said api.
From the "Generate" tab we will be able to generate a new transaction and from the "History" tab we will be able to observe the user's balance.
